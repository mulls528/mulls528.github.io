It's truly the age-old question. I mean, HE invited YOU. HE picked the spot. But is this a date? You aren't sure. I mean, if it was dinner
we could be a little more certain about his intentions. However, it's lunch. Lunch is a lawless land. Lunch is Switzerland. & let's be really honest:
the possibility of a free meal was a key motivator in your decision to come in the first place. Ah! That sounds horrific. 
He’s not particularly “unattractive”, but you’ve also never looked at him for this long before. 
Your mind is jumping through hoops while your mouth is jumping over conversational hurdles. 
The whole time you are just trying to figure out if you are actually interested in this fella or not. 
You hope he can’t see the par-core happening in your brain as he speaks. 
You catch words here and there, but your main priority is trying to figure out the intention of this meeting. 
Maybe it’s not even “like that”. Maybe he’s just a pal! 
A pal whom you’ve barely spoken to and randomly asks to commune with you in something as intimate as sitting across 
from each other at a table sharing a meal.

Oh boy, this is going to be harder to decode than you thought.
