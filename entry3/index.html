    I am obsessed with the business of the table: the breaking of bread, plates, and metaphorical walls.
    We have been the patrons of many "tables". Some of these experiences have been lovely, others have been less than ideal.
    Big or small, a shared meal is an act of communion. Communion isn't always elaborate. Sometimes it is quite simple.
    Communion can be messy, productive, beautiful, awkward, and everything inbetween. Communion is like this because the key players are humans &
    humans tend to be messy, productive, beautiful, awkward, and everything inbetween :)

    Today you will nagivate through the various "tables" we sit at. I use the word "table" loosely as our area of interest
    extends past the traditional four-legged surface. Some of these spaces you will enjoy. Some you will despise. Some may open up an archive of joyous memories.
    Some may unlock a deep cavern of forgotten memories. This is your business, but I am glad to be a cojourner with you today as we explore communion.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    So, without further ado, I would like to formally invite you to...
