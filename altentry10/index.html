    <h1> Forget About It! </h1>
    <h2> I wish I could sit here and tell you that every table experience ends in sunshine and rainbows.
        I regret to inform you: sometimes it just doesn't. Sometimes you just gotta move on from it! I'm not prescribing you to entirely block out bad experiences.
        There is lots to be learned. However, for the purpose of play (and being that I initially had something entirely different planned, but the code wasn't working), today
        we are going to race to cover up these bad experiences!
