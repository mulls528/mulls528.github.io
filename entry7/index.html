<h2>
    Welcome to Breakfast Abroad!
</h2>
<div class="paragraph-container">
    <p class="left-paragraph"> Though, you are so very sleepy.
        Jet-lag is proving to be an aggressive beast, showing no mercy on your closing eyelids.
        Your check-in time at the hotel is at 12:00pm, it’s currently 9:00am.
        Or at least you think it is.
        All of the clocks are in what you know to be Military Time.
        However, you never learned how to read it.
        Every once in a while someone teaches you and you briefly understand. 
        But, as soon as it’s no longer relevant, you forget.
        In all seriousness, time seems like a distant concept right now.
        Your body is operating on a completely different wavelength to your surroundings.
        It’s incredibly disorienting, but you're trying to fight it because you want to take in the newness of everything around you.
        Of course, it’s not really new.
        It’s all quite old actually. 
        But, it’s new to you. 
        As soon as you take charge of the menu, a fierce decoding process begins.
        The company at your table glues their eyes to their phones in a poor attempt to translate the words before you.
        You're confused and sleep-deprived brain waives the white flag on this effort quite quickly.
        You trust this atmosphere (and the obvious notion that you are not from here and the wait staff has certainly caught on) & leave it up to fate.
        You're ravenous and anything put before you will be consumed regardless of preference.
        

    </p>
    <p class="right-paragraph"> 
        You all discuss the "plans" for the day. 
        Everyone is forcing eachother to stay out and, more importantly, stay awake.
        You and your friends have been dreaming up this trip for while. 
        There was always a little pessimist living inside of you saying, "It's never gonna happen"
        This moment is dreamlike. 
        As you look around your table, you are struck by the dynamic going on here: you have landed yourself in an entirely unfamiliar context with the most familiar faces.
        After a long while of observing the beuaty that unfolds before you, you are prompted to speak:
        <br>
        <br> 
        <br>
        "Are you good?"
        <br>
        "I just can't believe we're actually here."
