<h2>
    Welcome to the Confrontational Coffee!
</h2>
<div class="paragraph-container">
    <p class="left-paragraph">Yeah, this isn't a fun one.
        You strategically choose a seat by the door for a quick getaway.
        Your palms are prespiring generously and your mouth feels like it hasn't been touched by water in a year.
        The barista alomost has a secret language with you. She knows what's happening. She knows this isn't a casual affair.
        She almost exhibits a sense of honor that you would choose her place of work to handle business this heavy. 
        You arrived early enough to collect your thoughts and practice the speech you've practiced in the shower more times than you can count.
        However, in typical fashion, they are running late. Now the margin of time you gave to comfort you, is only serving your self-destructive imagination:
        What if they never show up? What if my invitation was too suggestive of impending doom?
        What if this ruins our relationship forever? What if someone starts yelling?
        What if I cry? What if I make them cry?  What if I knock the candle over and the whole joint is set ablaze? 
    </p>
    <p class="right-paragraph">But then, in the midst of your spiraling, you hear the bell above the door jingle and a new character enters the scene.
        It's the guest you have been waiting for emerging from the lightness outside into the dimmed glow of the cafe.
        You flash a warm smile, hinting that the conversation that's about to take place is just as hard for you as it is for them.
        Except you have the luxury of preparedness, they do not. They don't know what to expect. But, maybe they do.
        Does this meeting have the same wait to you as it does to them? As they order at the counter, you take a few deep breaths.
        They sit down in front of you. The pleasantries ensue. You're waiting for your cue to get into the real stuff.
        <br>
        <br> 
        "So, what's up?" <br> This is your moment.
